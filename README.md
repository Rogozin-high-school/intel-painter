# wacom-hackathon  
This is an after-project of the project we did at the wacom-hackathon.  
This is a piece of software written using the UWP framework that allows the user to paint a painting and then, using AI style transfer neural networks and other black magic, change the style of the painting and change it's style to the style of a different painting made by someone else.
